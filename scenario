# Breakout 2 Scenario Cards
**Empathetic Feedback for Seasoned Supervisors | Advanced SLP**

---

> **FACILITATOR NOTE — How to use these:**
> Distribute one card per breakout group. Groups self-select their scenario based on what's closest to something real. Cards A–D are giving scenarios; E–F are receiving scenarios. Each card contains everything the group needs — no additional instructions required. The bilateral self-check questions are embedded so groups don't need a separate handout.

## SCENARIO A — The Distinguished Gap
### *EOY rating below expectation; employee anticipated more*

**The situation:**
Marcus has worked for you for three years. His work is consistently strong — thorough, accurate, well-regarded by peers. Throughout the year you've had regular check-ins, given him positive feedback, and felt good about how he was progressing. At year-end, you rate him **Exceeds Expectations** — an honest, well-documented rating.

When you deliver it, something shifts. Marcus goes quiet. Then: *"I thought I was on track for Distinguished. I've been working toward that all year."*

He's not angry. He's genuinely confused — and a little hurt. You can feel the conversation starting to close down.

**What you know:**
- Your rating is accurate and defensible
- The criteria for Distinguished were never explicitly discussed as a target
- Marcus has been a reliable, low-maintenance employee — you've never had a hard conversation with him before
- He's due for a promotion conversation in the next 12 months

**What you don't know:**
- Whether he understood what Distinguished actually requires
- How much of his year was spent working *toward* a goal you didn't know he had
- What he's feeling right now beyond confusion

**YOUR TASK — Breakout Practice**

*Part 1 — Self-Check (5 min, silent before you begin):*

Before you give this feedback, answer these three questions honestly:
1. What am I feeling about this conversation — and about Marcus right now?
2. What SCARF threat is Marcus experiencing in this moment?
3. What do I need to do in the first 60 seconds to reduce that threat?

*Part 2 — Pair Practice (15 min):*
- Person A opens the conversation as the supervisor using COIN. Pick up from the moment Marcus says *"I thought I was on track for Distinguished."*
- Person B plays Marcus — not a caricature, but a real person in threat response: hurt, confused, trying to stay professional.
- Group observes. Then switch roles.

*Part 3 — Group Debrief (10 min):*
1. What reduced threat in that conversation — and what accidentally increased it?
2. Did the Pause happen — "What's your read on this?" — and if not, why not?
3. What's the difference between how the conversation *sounds* and how it *lands*?

## SCENARIO B — The Plateaued Performer
### *Good work, same way, for years; role has evolved*

**The situation:**
Diane has been on your team for nine years. She's reliable, professional, and well-liked. Her work has always met expectations — sometimes exceeded them. But over the past two years the role has shifted: more cross-functional collaboration, more ambiguity, more expectation of independent initiative. Diane's work hasn't shifted with it. She's doing the same job she's always done — and doing it well. The problem is that's no longer enough.

You've been noticing this for about a year. You haven't said anything directly because her work isn't *bad* — it's just stopped growing. You're facing an end-of-year conversation where you need to rate her **Meets Expectations**, explain why, and open a conversation about what development would look like going forward.

You know this will surprise her. She thinks she's been performing at the same level she always has — because she has been.

**What you know:**
- Diane is not failing — she's frozen
- She has no idea the expectations around her have changed
- This conversation is at least six months overdue
- She is well-liked and has institutional knowledge you'd genuinely lose if she left

**What you don't know:**
- Whether she's aware the role has shifted
- Whether she *wants* to grow — or whether this job has become what she needs it to be for reasons you don't know
- How she'll respond when she realizes this has been building for a year

---

**YOUR TASK — Breakout Practice**

*Part 1 — Self-Check (5 min, silent before you begin):*

Before you give this feedback, answer these three questions honestly:
1. What am I feeling about this conversation — and about the fact that it's overdue?
2. What does Diane's brain likely expect walking into this meeting? Which SCARF threat is most activated?
3. What do I need to do in the first 60 seconds — and what do I need to *not* do?

*Part 2 — Pair Practice (15 min):*
- Person A opens the conversation as the supervisor. The goal is not just to deliver the rating — it's to open a genuine development conversation.
- Person B plays Diane — competent, professional, and genuinely blindsided when she realizes the expectation gap.
- Group observes. Then switch roles.

*Part 3 — Group Debrief (10 min):*
1. How do you give feedback about *growth* without it feeling like criticism of who someone is?
2. The self-empathy gap: what was the giver carrying into this room — and did it show?
3. What would the *Next* step in COIN look like for someone who may not want to change?

**One reporter:** Bring back one insight to the main room.

## SCENARIO C — Warned But Still Blindsided
### *Multiple prior conversations; impact still present at EOY*

**The situation:**
You've had the conversations. Three of them — in March, June, and September — about Derek's pattern of missing deadlines on collaborative deliverables. Each time, he acknowledged the feedback, seemed to understand the impact, and for a few weeks things improved. Then the pattern returned.

Now it's year-end. His rating is **Meets Expectations** — a rating that reflects the pattern, not just the individual incidents. You know he expected more. You also know you documented everything and the rating is fully defensible.

What you're dreading: Derek is going to say some version of *"You never told me this would affect my rating."* And technically, you never said those exact words — because you assumed the conversations made it clear.

**What you know:**
- Your rating is accurate and documented
- Derek received consistent feedback — but may not have connected it to consequences
- You are frustrated. You've had these conversations. You're tired of having them.
- Derek is otherwise a good employee — this pattern is specific, not global

**What you don't know:**
- Whether Derek genuinely didn't make the connection, or whether he's protecting himself
- How much of your frustration will show up in the first 30 seconds
- What's actually driving the pattern — you've addressed the symptom but maybe not the cause

---

**YOUR TASK — Breakout Practice**

*Part 1 — Self-Check (5 min, silent before you begin):*

Before you give this feedback, answer these three questions honestly:
1. What am I *actually* feeling about Derek and this conversation right now — frustration, resignation, something else?
2. How is my state going to show up if I don't address it before I open my mouth?
3. What does Derek's brain need in the first 60 seconds for this conversation to have any chance of landing?

*Part 2 — Pair Practice (15 min):*
- Person A opens the conversation. The challenge: deliver the rating clearly and without apology — while managing the frustration that's real and present.
- Person B plays Derek — someone who feels blindsided by the consequences even though he received the feedback. He's not lying. He genuinely didn't connect the dots.
- Group observes. Then switch roles.

*Part 3 — Group Debrief (10 min):*
1. What's the difference between accountability and punishment — and how does it show up in tone?
2. The Impact element of COIN: how do you name impact *again* without it feeling like a pile-on?
3. What's the Next step for someone who's heard this multiple times and keeps returning to the same pattern?

**One reporter:** Bring back one insight to the main room.

## SCENARIO D — The Avoider's First Hard Conversation
### *Delayed too long; relationship at stake*

**The situation:**
You've known for eight months that you need to have a direct conversation with Jordan about his communication style in team meetings — interrupting colleagues, dismissing ideas that aren't his, occasionally speaking over people in ways that are affecting team dynamics. You've told yourself: *it'll get better, he doesn't mean it, it's not bad enough yet, there's a better moment coming.*

There hasn't been a better moment. And now two of your other team members have separately mentioned they don't feel heard in meetings Jordan attends.

You've never had a hard conversation with Jordan. Your relationship is warm and easy — mostly because you've never challenged him on anything. You're now about to change the nature of that relationship, and you know it.

This isn't an EOY conversation. This is the conversation you should have had in April.

**What you know:**
- This is overdue — and Jordan will likely sense that
- Your avoidance is part of the problem; it allowed the pattern to continue
- The relationship matters to you, and you're afraid of losing it
- Jordan likely has no idea this is coming

**What you don't know:**
- How Jordan will receive this — he may be defensive, surprised, or genuinely unaware
- Whether the two team members who raised concerns would be willing to be named (they asked you not to)
- What you're actually afraid of: the conflict itself, or what it means about you as a supervisor

---

**YOUR TASK — Breakout Practice**

*Part 1 — Self-Check (5 min, silent before you begin):*

Before you give this feedback, answer these three questions honestly:
1. What has kept me from having this conversation — and is that reason still true today?
2. What SCARF threat am *I* experiencing going into this room?
3. What do I need to do — internally — in the first 60 seconds, for both of us?

*Part 2 — Pair Practice (15 min):*
- Person A opens the conversation. The challenge: be direct without being harsh — after months of not being direct enough.
- Person B plays Jordan — warm, caught off guard, and not immediately sure whether to be defensive or receptive.
- Group observes. Then switch roles.

*Part 3 — Group Debrief (10 min):*
1. What does the supervisor's state communicate before a word is spoken — in this scenario specifically?
2. How do you give feedback about a pattern when you weren't consistent about naming it in real time?
3. What does "relationship preservation" actually look like in this conversation — and what does it *not* look like?

**One reporter:** Bring back one insight to the main room.

## SCENARIO E — Unsolicited Peer Feedback
### *Critical feedback you didn't ask for and don't fully agree with*

**The situation:**
After a cross-divisional working group meeting, a peer supervisor — someone you respect but don't know well — sends you a Teams message. The gist: she thought your facilitation style in the meeting was "dominating" and that you were "shutting down" contributions from quieter members. She says she's telling you because she'd want someone to tell her.

You replay the meeting. You don't see it the way she described. You thought you were keeping the group on task. You moved people along because the meeting was running over. You asked for input — several times.

You feel defensive. You also feel a small, uncomfortable possibility that she might be partially right.

You're going to see her tomorrow in another joint meeting.

**What you know:**
- She gave you this feedback voluntarily and directly — that took something
- You disagree with the characterization, or at least with how strong it was
- You have a reaction you haven't fully processed
- You'll need to respond to her before tomorrow

**What you don't know:**
- What specifically she observed that you didn't
- Whether others in the room had the same experience
- Whether your defensiveness is protecting your ego, or protecting an accurate self-assessment — and how to tell the difference

---

**YOUR TASK — Breakout Practice**

*Part 1 — Self-Check (5 min, silent before you begin):*

Before you receive this feedback (or respond to it), answer these three questions honestly:
1. What am I feeling about this person and what she said — right now, before I've processed anything?
2. What story am I already telling myself about her intentions and her accuracy?
3. What do I need to do in the first 60 seconds of my response to stay open — even partially?

*Part 2 — Pair Practice (15 min):*
- Person A plays yourself — receiving this feedback, responding to her the next day.
- Person B plays the peer — she meant well, she's not backing down, but she's also not trying to wound you.
- Group observes. Then switch roles.

*Part 3 — Group Debrief (10 min):*
1. What does "staying open" actually look like when you disagree — not just sound like?
2. What's the difference between receiving feedback graciously and pretending to agree?
3. How does your response to this feedback affect the psychological safety of the people around you — even if the conversation is private?

**One reporter:** Bring back one insight to the main room.

## SCENARIO F — Supervisor Feedback That Surprises
### *Your own leader says something that feels unfair or unexpected*

**The situation:**
Your own supervisor — someone you have a generally solid relationship with — pulls you aside after a senior leadership meeting. She tells you that she's heard from two other directors that you can be "difficult to work with" on cross-divisional priorities, and that your team is sometimes seen as not being collaborative. She doesn't name the directors. She says she wants you to be aware of it before it "becomes a pattern."

You are caught completely off guard. You've worked hard on cross-divisional relationships. You can think of specific examples where you went out of your way to be collaborative. You have no idea what specifically is being referred to, and the feedback is vague enough that you can't defend yourself against it — or take action on it.

You feel a combination of: surprised, hurt, and quietly furious.

The meeting continues for another 45 minutes. You have to sit there.

**What you know:**
- This feedback was based on secondhand information you weren't given access to
- Your supervisor delivered it somewhat awkwardly — she was clearly uncomfortable too
- You have a real reaction that you cannot fully express in this moment
- You need to respond to her — but not right now, not in this state

**What you don't know:**
- What was actually said, by whom, or in what context
- Whether your supervisor believes it, or is just passing it along
- Whether there's anything accurate in it that you haven't been able to see

**YOUR TASK — Breakout Practice**

*Part 1 — Self-Check (5 min, silent before you begin):*

Before you receive — or respond to — this feedback, answer these three questions honestly:
1. What am I feeling right now — and which of those feelings is going to be hardest to manage?
2. What story am I telling myself about my supervisor's motives and judgment?
3. What do I need to do in the next 60 seconds — and in the conversation I'll need to have later — to stay open to even the 10% of this that might be useful?

*Part 2 — Pair Practice (15 min):*
- Person A plays yourself — first in the immediate moment (how do you hold it together for 45 minutes), then in the follow-up conversation with your supervisor.
- Person B plays the supervisor — not a villain, just someone who delivered this imperfectly and knows it.
- Group observes. Then switch roles.

*Part 3 — Group Debrief (10 min):*
1. What does regulation look like when you genuinely believe the feedback is unfair?
2. What's the difference between advocating for yourself and being defensive?
3. Your team watches how you receive feedback. If they knew about this conversation — what would they see?
